  <p> I picked MrTLexify because he is one of my favortie youtubers.I like MrTLexify because he is funny, he plays COD Zombies. In one of his videos he did a 100 layers of pepperoni pizza challenge.In the challenge he bought 13 large dominos pizza,and it costed over 100 dollars.Then he went to some random place,then his friends started to throw large pizzas at him,on the floor.  </p>
<p>Also he does livestreams on Twitch, and on Youtube. In one of his livestreams he was doing a zombies livestream. During the livestream his mom walks in his room and asks if he wants pepperoni pizza. Also during one of his other livestreams he was playing on The Giant a zombies map on Black Ops 3. When he was playing on that map he died on round 5 when he died round 5 he went to go open his window and tried to jump out of the window. Then his mom walked in and caught him opening the window.<img src=""
